# WebGL Tutorial in React-Typescript
I'm following along with [Mozilla's WebGL Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) and trying to adapt it to React and TypeScript along the way.

At the end of this, I'm hoping to have a template that I can use for other projects.
